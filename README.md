# Urban-food

Urban food is an interactive application that utilises an API to find nearest restaurants using the users current location. The application would show information about the nearest food joint / restaurant, distance, restaurant opening hours, pricing, user rating etc. It would also show a map showing the location of the selected restaurant. The aim of the application is to help users find nearest places to eat. The application would have a strong focus on design and usability. 

The app has a strong focus on design and usability.

I have utilised Yelp API to help look up accurate restaurant data. The home screen displays a list of the top 10 restaurants based on user’s current location. Then the data is sorted to provide the results based on the distance between the user’s current location and the restaurant location.

As I mentioned, users can also add thier own restaurant to a local list for which Core Data database was used.
